Before compiling:
copy all the files into your MagicMirror M1560210/KinectSDK folder. The files should contain:
Camera_Kinect.cpp and its header file
GestureController.cpp and its header file
Gesture.cpp and its header file
GestureReceiver.cpp + GestureSource.cpp(not required anymore)
Segments folder, which contains the smaller broken up gestures and their header files
stdafx.h-links to all the .h files

To compile:

Copy these files into your magic mirror Kinect SDK folder(where all your source files 
and header files are)
Go to solution explorer in Visual C++(usually at the right hand side of the Visual C++ IDE)
Right click on the folders(source, header), and click add->existing items
In the folder browser, add the respective header and source files mentioned in the step before compiling. 
Try not to add the wrong file into the wrong heading
Add the segment folder in the solution explorer. This folder contains all the gestures broken up into segments
Add existing segmented gesture items(same procedure as earlier) into the segments folder under 
the solution explorer
Build the code


To use:

Add all the relevant header files inside stdafx.h
Create a gesture controller object in the cameraKinect.cpp(not necessary)
Add the function gestureController->UpdateAllGestures2(Skeleton *data) inside the internal Kinect class
where frames are constantly being updated(fps).(not necessary)

...

Misc:
For other codeable gestures, code them in .cpp and .h and place them under the segments folder. 
Add the relevant header files inside the main program(or stdafx.h) when u want to use those gestures later
